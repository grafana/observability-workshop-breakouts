## App O11y
Q: What error message is the productcatalog service throwing when it errors?

A: There are a few answers to this depending on how you decide to find the answer
- Traces Approach: 
  - `pq: sorry, too many clients already`
- Logs Approach
  - `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`
  - `pq: sorry, too many clients already`

To find this:
1. Open the Application Observability App
1. Make sure you're on the Services tab 
1. Click on the `productcatalogservice` service
    
    ### Option 1 - Traces Approach
    1. Within the `Errors` panel, click the `Traces` button as shown here

    1. Click on any of the `Trace ID`s within the table - they all show error traces from the Productcatalog Service

    1. A specific trace waterfall diagram should appear. Click on the `productcatalogservice` span with a red circle next to it to inspect 
    1. Click on `Events (2)` and expand both events
      
        ![Events](/images/breakout_1/2.3-app-o11y-3.png)

    1. This shows an `exception` and `error` event, both of which with the value `pq: sorry, too many clients already` showing our error

    ### Option 2 - Logs Approach
    1. Click on the `Logs` tab at the top to see all the logs generated by this service
    1. We can see that there are many `pq: sorry, too many clients already` logs as well as a poorly formatted stack trace over many lines. You may have to scroll down in the logs to see `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`
