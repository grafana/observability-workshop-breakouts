## Asserts
Q: Which service started having errors first in the context of the last 24 hours? 

A: `productcatalogservice`, however in some views you may see that `productcatalog-postgres` was impacted first instead. The order of these two is fickle because they both error at similar times and it depends on when the metric is scrapped to indicate the exact order.

To find this:

1. Follow on from the last question so you are in the RCA workbench with the connected services added
1. Make sure you're sorted by time like in the last question
1. Click on the `Summary` tab, it's much easier to read

1. The exact order of assertions here may change in your workshop breakout depending on a few events but the assertions will stay the same. A few of the outcomes are:
    - The productcatalog-postgres throws `PostgresSQLHighConnections` failure assertions along with a few anomaly asserts
    - The productcatalogservice service throws `ErrorBuildup` and `ErrorRatioBreach` error assertions on its `oteldemo.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts` endpoint as well a `KubePodCrashLooping` failure assertions
