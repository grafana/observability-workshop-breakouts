Q: Which service started having errors first? 

A: `productcatalogservice`

To find this:

1. Follow on from the last question so you are in the RCA workbench with the problematic services added
1. Make sure you're sorted by time like in the last question
1. Click on the `Summary` tab, it's much easier to read

1. From here we can see that the productcatalog service started erroring first. It had a `KubePodCrashLoop` assertion and `ErrorRatioBreach` assertion.
1. Next we can see the productcatalog-postgres service had a `PostgresSQLHighConnections` assertion
1. All other assertions are Anomaly assertions, not error or failure assertions
