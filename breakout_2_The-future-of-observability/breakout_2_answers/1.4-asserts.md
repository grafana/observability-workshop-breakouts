Q: Which namespace is everything deployed in?

A: `ditl-demo-prod`

To find this:
There are a few ways to find this
1) Go to the entity explorer, look at all services and see which namespace they are in by hovering over them... that will take a while. 
2) Go to the search bar in the Entity Explorer and type `Show all Namespaces` - this returns two `kube-system` and `ditl-demo-prod`. It won't be `kube-system` so must be `ditl-demo-prod`
