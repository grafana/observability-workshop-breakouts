## Asserts
Q: Which service looks to be in the worst state? Why?

A: `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod` because it has more Assertions firing than the other services. It has the following:
- Failure: The associated pod has KubePodCrashLooping
- Anomaly: The service has x2 LatencyAverageAnomaly  
- Error: The service has ErrorRatioBreach

To find this:
- Open Asserts Entity Explorer and look at the list of services on the left ordered by `Assertions`. This shows the entity in the worst state.

- You can then hover over the entity to see it's assertions
