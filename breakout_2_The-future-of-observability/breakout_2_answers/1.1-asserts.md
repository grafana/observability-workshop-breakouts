## Asserts
Q: Over the last 24 hours which service looks to be in the worst state? Why?

A: `frontendservice-ditl-demo-prod` because it has more Assertions firing than the other services. It has the following:
- Error:
    - INBOUND:span_errors::ErrorRatioBreach
    - INBOUND:span_errors::ErrorBuildup
    - OUTBOUND:span_errors::ErrorRatioBreach
    - OUTBOUND:span_errors::ErrorBuildup

To find this:
1. Open Asserts Entity Explorer and look at the list of services on the left ordered by `Assertions`. This shows the entity in the worst state.

1. You can then hover over the entity to see it's assertions
