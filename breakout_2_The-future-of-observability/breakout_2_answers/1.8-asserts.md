Q: Why is the recommendation service impacted by this issue?

A: The recommendation service has an endpoint called `ListRecommendations`, this endpoint uses the ProductCatalogService. As the ProductCatalogService crash loops we can see the latency for the `ListRecommendations` spike.

To find this:
- Open RCA Workbench with `productcatalogservice` and add problematic connections. For guidance on how to do this [see this guidance](./1.5-asserts.md)
- Click `Open graph preview` at the bottom right

- From here we can see that the recommendationservice uses the productcatalogservice
- We can see that the `/oteldemo.RecommendationService.ListRecommendations` endpoint within the recommendation service has a latency anomaly. Click that assertion to see the actual data

- We can see a tidy correlation to this with the `KubePodCrashLooping` assertion on the productcatalogservice. Click on this assertion to see that correlation

- This seems to be as the pod crashes, the latency goes up until the pod restarts
