## Asserts
Q: What looks to be the first event that caused the issue? 

A: A feature flag was enabled called `productCatalogStopClosingPostgresConnections`

This is a custom assertion that was uploaded, it's based on a recording rule which looks at the logs from the feature flag service. If the recording rule has a value greater than 0 (a feature flag state was changed) then the assertion fires.

To use the below URLs, replace `{STACK_URL}` with the url of the environment used for this lab.

- Recording Rule: `{STACK_URL}/alerting/list?search=FeatureStateChange`
- Custom Assertion - `{STACK_URL}/a/grafana-asserts-app/rules/add/file` & then click on the edit icon next to `fieldengotelenv.yml`

To find this:
- Open Asserts Entity Explorer and find the productcatalog-ditl-demo-prod service
- Click the `Troubleshoot in Workbench` button

- Click on `Add Problematic Connections`

- Sort by Time
![allentities](/images/breakout_2/1.5-asserts-1.png)
- We can now see the featureflagservice is top, this means it's assertion fired first
- Click on it
- Click on the `amend` category
- We can see that the amend assertion is `FeatureFlagStateChange`

- We can dig into the detail to see which feature flag. Click on `FeatureFlagStateChange` and hover over the series shown in the metrics graph

- This shows us that the `productCatalogStopClosingPostgresConnections` feature flag was turned on. Later on, we can also see it was turned off.
