## Asserts
Q: What looks to be the first event that caused the issue within the last 24 hours? 

A: A feature flag was enabled called `productCatalogStopClosingPostgresConnections`

This is a custom assertion that was uploaded, it's based on a recording rule which looks at the logs from the feature flag service. If the recording rule has a value greater than 0 (a feature flag state was changed) then the assertion fires.

To find this the first event that caused the issue:
1. Open Asserts Entity Explorer and find the productcatalog-ditl-demo-prod service like in [question 2](/breakout_2_The-future-of-observability/breakout_2_answers/1.2-asserts.md) you can either point and click or type `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod` into the search bar and select `Show Service productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod`

There are two ways to add an Entity to the RCA workbench. Via the Entity Graph or via the results table:
Via the Entity Graph:
1. Click on `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod`
1. Click the `Troubleshoot in Workbench` button

Via the Results Table:
1. Hover over `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod` in the results table
1. Click `Add to Workbench for inspecting`

1. Click `Open in Workbench`

Now you have the productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod service added to the RCA workbench, let's see what's going on.

1. Click on the second icon on the left which is `Add potential causes`

1. Sort by Time

1. We can now see the featureflagservice is top, this means it's assertion fired first. There is the occasional scenario where the `frontend-ditl-demo-prod` service fires an anomaly assertion first, this is as it might take a minute or two for the feature flag assertion to fire depending on a range of factors in the demo environment.
1. Click on it
1. Click on the `amend` category
1. We can see that the amend assertion is `FeatureFlagStateChange`

1. We can dig into the detail to see which feature flag. Click on `FeatureFlagStateChange` and hover over the series shown in the metrics graph

    ![allentities](/images/breakout_2/1.5-asserts-3.png)

1. This shows us that the `productCatalogStopClosingPostgresConnections` feature flag was turned on. Later on, we can also see it was turned off.

**Custom Dashboards**

We have added a custom dashboard to the KPI drawer for the feature flag service. You can see this by clicking on the `KPI` icon on the far right next to the feature flag service.

This then shows a custom dashboard we have made listing all feature flags and their current state.

You can see how this was done by going to the Asserts menu, Configuration and then clicking on KPI display options.

This gives the ability to add any dashboard to any service or type of service, allowing you, the user, to expand what insight Asserts gives you within just a few clicks and without leaving the context of finding the root cause of an issue.

**Optional:**

If you'd like to see how a custom assertion was created for this, you can use the below URLs. Replace `{STACK_URL}` with the url of the environment used for this lab.

- Recording Rule: `{STACK_URL}/alerting/list?search=FeatureStateChange`
- Custom Assertion - `{STACK_URL}/a/grafana-asserts-app/rules/add/file` & then click on the edit icon next to `fieldengotelenv.yml`
