## Asserts
Q: How many application services are connected to the productcatalog service within the last 24 hours?

A: Between 5 and 7 services 
- The alloy receiver is not counted as it is not a part of the application
- Depending on how k8s decided to route some requests, there may also be an additional 1 or 2 checkout services in different regions

To find this there are three options:

### Option 1 - Via Entity Explorer Graph
1. Open Asserts Entity Explorer and find the productcatalog, click on it and expand `Connected Entities`
