## Asserts
Q: How many problematic services are there connected to the productcatalog service?

A: Three or Four depending on your outlook. `Amend` rules are not necssarily bad, they are informational. So if you're glass half empty you may count the featureflag service which has an Amend assertion firing. If you're glass half full, you'd ignore that assertion as it's just informational :)

To find this there are two options:
1) Via Entity Explorer
- Open Asserts Entity Explorer and find the productcatalog-ditl-demo-prod service
- Hover over it so the tooltip which shows assertions appears

- Expand `Connected Entities` by clicking on the text

- Click `Open` next to `Services`

- Count how many have assertions (coloured rings around the entities)

2) Via RCA Workbench

- Ignore the node, the question is all about services :) 
- The above image shows three or four depending on whether you count the featureflagservice
