## K8s O11y
Q: How many restarts has the productcatalog service had?

A: The total number of restarts varies as this service is constantly failing (by design) so instead of giving an answer you can double check your value by doing one of the following options to get to the product catalog service pod.

To find this there are two options:

### Option 1 - Via App o11y
  1. Open the Application Observability App
  1. Make sure you're on the Services tab 
  1. Click on the `productcatalogservice` service
  1. Click on the Kubernetes button and find the `k8s.pod.name` entry
  1. See the `number of restarts` entry under `Pod information`

  1. Click the productcatalogservice entry that doesn't contain `europe`. This will take you to the deployment overview. To see pod specific data, click on the pod name in the `pods` table
