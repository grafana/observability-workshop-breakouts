Q: What's the pod name running the product catalog service?

A: This will change over time as pods get restarted but it will start with  `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod-....` as an example `productcatalogservice-ditl-demo-prod-6d66db6fd8-shwcj`

To find this:
1. Open the Application Observability App
1. Make sure you're on the Services tab 
1. Click on the `productcatalogservice` service
1. Click on the Kubernetes button and find the `k8s.pod.name` entry
