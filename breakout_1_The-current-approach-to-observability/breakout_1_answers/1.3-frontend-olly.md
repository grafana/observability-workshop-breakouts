## Frontend O11y
Q:  In the last 1 hour which pages have errors?

A: All four pages:
- `/`
- `/cart`
- `/cart/checkout/*`
- `/product/*`

To find this:
1. Open the frontend observability app
1. Select the `ditl-demo` app
1. See see the page IDs within the Page Performance Panel and check which ones have errors, it seems they all do!
