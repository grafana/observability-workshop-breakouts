Q: What's the most common error?

A: We are able to get the most common error message - since frontend o11y has data coming from logs in this situation and Grafana Assistant is looking at a metrics datasource, additional prompting is required to get the specifics of the error.

The error details don't really tell us what is going on, since frontend o11y urtilizes logs as well let's ask to take a look at that datasource
