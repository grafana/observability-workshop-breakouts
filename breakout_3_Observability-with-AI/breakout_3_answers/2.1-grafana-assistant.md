Q: What's the health of my containers?

A: This highlights containers with repetitive restarts, bad k8s events, errors, etc. ie productcatalogservice, recommendationservice, and checkoutservice instances are noted to have concerning health.
```
Container health summary
Your cluster shows mixed health with some concerning issues that need attention:

ðŸ”´ Critical issues
productcatalogservice pod has 116 restarts - This indicates a serious stability problem requiring immediate investigation
58 pods are not in Running state across multiple namespaces (Failed, Pending, Succeeded, Unknown phases)

ðŸŸ¡ Moderate concerns
Multiple checkoutservice instances have 2-3 restarts across different regions, suggesting potential systematic issues
Resource consumption patterns show some pods using significant CPU and memory resources

âœ… Positive observations
90+ containers have zero restarts, indicating most of your infrastructure is stable
System-level pods show efficient resource utilization

Key findings
Resource usage:

kafka-bus pod is your highest CPU consumer at 28.77%
orders-db pod uses the most memory at 485 MiB
recommendationservice shows high CPU usage at 11.90%

Pod health:

Most failures are in ditl-demo-prod and kube-system namespaces
Alloy monitoring components appear in both failed and high-resource-usage lists
