## Knowledge Graph
Q: Which service started having errors first in the context of the last 24 hours? 

A: `productcatalogservice`, however in some views you may see that `productcatalog-postgres` was impacted first instead. The order of these two is fickle because they both error at similar times and it depends on when the metric is scrapped to indicate the exact order. There is the occasional scenario where the `frontend` service fires an anomaly insight first, this is as it might take a minute or two for the feature flag insight to fire depending on a range of factors in the demo environment.

To find this:

1. Follow on from the last question so you are in the RCA workbench with the services which have potential issues added
1. Make sure you're sorted by time like in the last question
1. Click on the `Summary` tab, it's much easier to read

1. The exact order of insights here may change in your workshop breakout depending on a few events but the insights will stay the same. A few of the outcomes are:
    - The productcatalog-postgres throws `PostgresSQLHighConnections` failure insights along with a few anomaly insights
    - The productcatalogservice service throws `ErrorBuildup` and `ErrorRatioBreach` error insights on its `oteldemo.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts` endpoint as well a `KubePodCrashLooping` failure insights
    - The frontend service has a number of anomalies as well as `ErrorBuildup` and `ErrorRatioBreach` error insights - this is as all requests go through the frontend services as it's an API gateway. If a downstream service is having an issue, it will often propagate up to the frontend service. We can see that the frontend service also complains that the recommendation service is having an issue. This isn't shown at the moment because we clicked the `Add potential causes` button on the productcatalogservice which doesn't call the recommendation service. Go back to the Timeline view (Summary is read only) and click `Add potential causes` on the frontend service. This will add a few more services like the recommendation service.
