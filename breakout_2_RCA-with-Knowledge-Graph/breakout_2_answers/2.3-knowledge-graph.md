## Knowledge Graph
Q:  What error message is the productcatalog service throwing when it errors in the last 24 hours?

A: There are a few answers to this depending on how you decide to find the answer
- Traces Approach: 
  - `pq: sorry, too many clients already`
- Logs Approach
  - `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`
  - `pq: sorry, too many clients already`

There are a few ways to find this but we are keen to show you the context driven RCA workbench here
- Open RCA Workbench with `productcatalogservice` and add connected services. For guidance on how to do this [see this guidance](./1.5-knowledge-graph.md)
- Click on the summary tab as it's easier to read, but you can also do the same steps in timeline if you'd rather
- Hover over the red bar of the `oteldemo.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts - ErrorRatioBreach` assertion

- Click on Logs - This takes you to Logs tab of the KPI Drawer at the timeframe of that assertion and shows all error messages. As you can see we have two `pq: sorry, too many clients already` and `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`

- Close the KPI Drawer
- Hover over the red bar of the `oteldemo.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts - ErrorRatioBreach` assertion again
- Click Traces - This takes you to the Traces tab of the KPI drawer at the timeframe of that assertion, then select the error radio button to show all errored traces

- Click on any trace
- Click on the productcatalogservice span with a red circle next to it
![allentities](/images/breakout_2/2.3-knowledge-graph-4.png)
- Expand events for that span, it shows us `pq: sorry, too many clients already`
