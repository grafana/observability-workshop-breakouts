## Knowledge Graph
Q: Over the last 24 hours which service looks to be in the worst state? Why?

A: `frontend` service because it has more insights firing than the other services. This is as the frontend service is an API gateway. All services' traffic/requests go through it and therefore errors propagate upwards to it triggering insights. It has the following:
- Errors/Anomalies:
    - INBOUND:LatencyAverageAnomaly
    - INBOUND:span_errors::ErrorBuildup
    - OUTBOUND:LatencyAverageAnomaly
    - OUTBOUND:span_errors::ErrorBuildup

To find this:
1. Open Entity Explorer and look at the list of services on the left ordered by `insights`. This shows the entity in the worst state.

1. You can then hover over the entity to see it's insights
